    "As onion changes it colour put Garam masala, salt, Red chilli, Corriondar powder, Chicken Masala and let it cook for some time. It will be a dry mixture but let those spices cook for 2 minutes. ",
    "Now, add 3 tablespoons of yoghurt to the mix and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes",
    "Add chicken in the curry and mix it properly so that all the chicken gets covered in curry",
    "Cover the pot with a lid for 5 minutes, during this time the chicken will loose some water into the curry. If after 5 minutes the curry is too dry then add a little bit of water to avoid the curry to stick to the pot",
